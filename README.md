# Next.js
In this project, which allows users to view meals, share meals, and be part of a foodies community.

And the special thing about this project is that it's actually a fullstack application, so front-end and backend combined into one project.

**In this project, I have:**

- Set up routes and pages in Next.js

- Worked with React components

- Fetched and sent data between the client and server

- Styled the application and worked with images

- Configured page metadata

## Setup

1. Clone the project
1. Install node, e.g. with `brew install nodejs`
1. Install node packages by running `sudo npm install`
1. Run the project by `npm run dev`

Then access <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a> in your browser.
